# forth.rb

### A tiny Forth implementation in Ruby

Currently I am reading `Starting Forth` along with `Thinking Forth` and in my view, learning this fantastic language almost demands that we implement a toy interpreter of our own. I will be updating this implementation as I progress more in those books. 

#### How to run?

You need a working Ruby interpreter installed in the system. I am using Ruby 3.0. Once you have a working Ruby interpreter and checked out the code, simply run:

`ruby run_forth.rb`

#### Example
